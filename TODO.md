- feature: examine a user's prompts and makes suggestions as to how to improve them so that they:
  * Solve the intended problem
  * use the best language for Claude Code
  * NOTE: Using better prompts lead to better AI generate code and less frustration. Move user's don't know how to write prompts. 
  * A user should be able to select any of their prompts and click a "analyze" button that will submit the prompt, along with the required context, to have Claude Code write an improved prompt. For this feature to work the user will have to setup their api token in a .env file. The user should be able to add their api token directly from within the website so they don't have to edit text files manually.
